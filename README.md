# Oxidized Transformers

Oxidized Transformers is a Rust transformers library that started out as
a port of [Curated Transformers](https://github.com/explosion/curated-transformers/tree/main).
The foundations are in place and some popular models are implemented, but
Oxidized Transformers is still too volatile to use in projects. Keep an eye
on the repo, since progress is currently fast.
